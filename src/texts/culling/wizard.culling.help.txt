This panel deals with the Culling parameter. It means that only for a feature to be used in the analysis, it has to be in at least this much percent of texts. The lower it is, the less amount of features will be used, but they will be more widespread among texts. If you set the minimum and the maximum to the same, it will only use that one value (and it is recommended most of the time)
