This panel deals with the MFW (Most Frequent Word) parameter, altough it is better to call it most frequent element, because it is technically the element you set at the features panel. It means that only the MFW % of the most frequent fords will be used in the analysis. The lower it is, the more of the less frequent elements will be used. Down under this text the top 10 most frequent words are displayed. If you set the minimum and the maximum to the same, it will only use that one value (and it is recommended most of the time)
